   - Enable data anonymization
   - Configure keyword filtering
   - Focus on educational metrics only

4. **Xenon Configuration** (45 minutes):
   - Exclude sensitive channels from backups
   - Configure content type filtering
   - Enable encrypted storage for retained data
   - Set up 90-day retention policy

### PHASE 2: Performance Optimization (Priority 2)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Complete After Compliance Fixed**

1. **Xenon Memory Optimization** (60 minutes):
   - Enable selective channel backup
   - Change backup frequency to weekly (Sunday 03:00 UTC)

   - Enable maximum compression

2. **Statbot Response Optimization** (30 minutes):
   - Enable aggressive caching (1-hour duration)
   - Configure batch processing (15-minute intervals)
   - Optimize database queries
   - Enable connection pooling

### PHASE 3: Production Verification (Priority 3)
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes  
**Final Validation Before Go-Live**

1. Run compliance verification tests
2. Execute performance benchmarks
3. Verify monitoring alerts are functioning
4. Confirm rollback procedures are accessible
