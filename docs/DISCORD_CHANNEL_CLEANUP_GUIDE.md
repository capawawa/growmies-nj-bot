# ðŸ§¹ Discord Channel Cleanup Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the comprehensive Discord channel cleanup system created for the GrowmiesNJ server. The cleanup script identifies and removes duplicate channels outside the proper category structure while preserving important messages and maintaining full audit trails.

## Problem Addressed

The GrowmiesNJ Discord server had duplicate channels at the bottom that were outside the proper category structure. These duplicates needed to be cleaned up to ensure proper organization according to the intended 4-category structure.

## Intended Server Structure

The server should have all channels organized within these 4 categories:

1. **ðŸŒ¿ WELCOME & INFO** - welcome, rules, age-verification channels
2. **ðŸ’¬ GENERAL COMMUNITY (18+)** - general-chat, gaming-and-entertainment, photos-and-memes, general-voice
3. **ðŸŒ± CANNABIS DISCUSSION (21+)** - strain-discussions, growing-tips, dispensary-reviews, harvest-showcase, medical-cannabis, cannabis-voice  
4. **ðŸ”§ MODERATION & STAFF** - staff-general, audit-logs

## Duplicate Channels Identified

The script identifies and removes these duplicate channels outside categories:
- `general` â†’ maps to `general-chat`
- `rules` â†’ maps to `rules-and-compliance`
- `age-verification` â†’ maps to `age-verification`
- `general-chat` â†’ maps to `general-chat`
- `growing-discussion` â†’ maps to `growing-tips`
- `nj-dispensaries` â†’ maps to `dispensary-reviews`
- `strain-reviews` â†’ maps to `strain-discussions`

## Script Features

### Core Functionality
- **Channel Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of current server structure
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies channels outside categories that match the mapping
- **Message Preservation**: Checks for messages in duplicate channels and preserves them
- **Safe Migration**: Moves message summaries to proper category channels
- **Clean Deletion**: Removes duplicate channels after message preservation
- **Structure Verification**: Confirms final structure matches intended organization

### Safety Features
- **Dry Run Mode**: `--dry-run` flag simulates cleanup without making changes
- **Force Protection**: `--force` flag required for actual cleanup operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays between operations to avoid Discord API limits
- **Full Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all operations
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with rollback capabilities
- **Message Backup**: Creates summary of moved messages in target channels

### Reporting
- **Real-time Logging**: Timestamped logs with different severity levels
- **Cleanup Reports**: Detailed JSON reports saved to `/docs/channel-cleanup-report.json`
- **Verification Results**: Final structure validation with pass/fail status
- **Operation History**: Complete log of all operations performed

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure Discord bot token is configured in environment variables
2. Verify guild ID is set correctly
3. Bot must have appropriate permissions (Manage Channels, Read Messages, Send Messages)

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Show help and usage information
node scripts/cleanup-discord-channels.js --help

# Test run (recommended first step)
node scripts/cleanup-discord-channels.js --dry-run

# Actual cleanup (after testing)
node scripts/cleanup-discord-channels.js --force
```

### Environment Setup

Required environment variables:
```bash
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
GUILD_ID=your_discord_server_guild_id_here
```

### Command Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Simulate cleanup without making changes |
| `--force` | Actually perform cleanup (required for real changes) |
| `--help` | Show help message and usage information |

## Safety Protocols

### Pre-Cleanup Steps
1. **Always test first**: Run with `--dry-run` to simulate the process
2. **Review logs**: Check the analysis output for expected duplicates
3. **Verify mapping**: Ensure duplicate channels map to correct targets
4. **Check permissions**: Confirm bot has necessary permissions

### During Cleanup
1. **Monitor progress**: Watch real-time logs for any issues
2. **Check rate limits**: Script includes delays to avoid API limits
3. **Verify operations**: Each step is logged with success/failure status

### Post-Cleanup Steps  
1. **Review reports**: Check the generated cleanup report
2. **Verify structure**: Confirm final structure matches intended organization
3. **Test functionality**: Ensure all channels work correctly
4. **Archive logs**: Save cleanup reports for audit purposes

## Script Architecture

### Class Structure
- **DiscordChannelCleanup**: Main cleanup management class
- **Channel Analysis**: Comprehensive structure analysis methods
- **Message Handling**: Safe message preservation and migration
- **Verification**: Final structure validation and reporting

### Key Methods
- `analyzeCurrentStructure()`: Analyzes existing channel structure
- `checkChannelMessages()`: Checks for messages needing preservation
- `findTargetChannel()`: Locates proper category channels for duplicates
- `moveMessages()`: Creates message summaries in target channels
- `deleteChannel()`: Safely removes duplicate channels
- `verifyFinalStructure()`: Validates final organization

## Error Handling

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Environment Variables**: Script validates required Discord credentials
2. **Permission Errors**: Clear error messages for insufficient bot permissions
3. **Channel Not Found**: Graceful handling of missing target channels
4. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays and retry logic for API limits
5. **Network Issues**: Connection error handling with appropriate timeouts

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Partial Failures**: Script continues processing other channels if one fails
2. **Rollback Information**: Detailed logs enable manual rollback if needed
3. **State Preservation**: Operation log tracks exactly what was completed
4. **Error Reporting**: Clear error messages with specific failure reasons
